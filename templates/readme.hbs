## Use in the player

To configure [videojs-contrib-eme] you can follow the docs on the [videojs-contrib-eme README], but a sample is included in `sample-code.js` for [Clear Key] encrypted content created by the script. Much of the logic is borrowed from the [videojs-contrib-eme example].


## Serving locally

To serve the files for testing, some browsers (e.g., Chrome) require a secure environment for the EME APIs. This means that you must serve the page and content over HTTPS.

An easy setup for an insecure HTTPS environment may be done as follows:

```bash
# (set Common Name to localhost when prompted)
$ openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server --cors --ssl --key server.key --cert server.cert
```
